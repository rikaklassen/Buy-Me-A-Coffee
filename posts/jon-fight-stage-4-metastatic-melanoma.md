# Jon's Fight with Stage 4 Metastatic Melanoma
Sep 13, 2023

> Many of you know that Jon Henner has been giving the finger to cancer for the last 6 years. I'm heartbroken to tell you that Jon left this mortal coil on Monday, August 14th at 7:16am.
> 
> The celebration of life for Jon Henner will be October 14th, at 6pm, in Greensboro, NC. All are welcome to the [first annual Jon-a-thon](https://www.evite.com/event/004EIEMU3LNY6YKLKEPOJN2YUZPHKQ).
>
> Emily, the children, and Jon's beloved family are finding their way forward during this time and greatly appreciate all the support they have received. With Jon gone, [your gifts help Emily and the girls move forward](https://www.gofundme.com/f/jons-fight-with-stage-4-metastatic-melanoma) without major medical debt as they navigate this new and challenging life.
